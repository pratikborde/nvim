# Neovim config

This is a heavy coc.nvim based set up that works well for me. To install please view the below.

## Dependencies

1. [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim) or `brew install neovim`

    I have not tested this on vim as I primarily use neovim but I believe it should work out of the box.

2. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

    Node is required for [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim)

3. [Rg](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)

    Rg/ripgrep is required for blazing fast grep.

### Optional dependencies

1. [Livedown](https://github.com/shime/vim-livedown) - npm install -g livedown

## Install instructions

1. `git clone https://github.com/pratikborde/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim`
2. Start neovim with `nvim` in the shell
