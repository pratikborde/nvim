# NOTE: I have since moved to vim, [my config](https://github.com/sparkcanon/vim/)
# Neovim config

This set up that works well for me. To install please view the below.

## Dependencies

1. [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim)

    `brew install neovim`

2. [Rg](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)

    Rg/ripgrep is required for blazing fast grep.
    

## Install instructions

1. `git clone https://github.com/pratikborde/nvim.git $HOME/.config/nvim`
2. Start neovim with `nvim` in the shell
3. Wait for the echo `installed`
